## Contributing

OmicIDX is an open source project and we love getting patches and contributions to make the project and its docs even better.

The code and documentation live in multiple repositories at the [OmicIDX Github organization](https://github.com/omicidx). The [Developer Documentation](/docs/developer) gives details of the individual repositories, their contents, and role in the OmicIDX ecosystem.
