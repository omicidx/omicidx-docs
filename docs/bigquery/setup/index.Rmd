## Initial setup



### No existing GCP account or billing

Bigquery is a cloud service run by Google. If you already have a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account and a project with billing enabled, *skip to the [Existing GCP account or project]* section below.

The BigQuery sandbox is available to anyone with a Google Cloud Platform account. If you do not have such an account, you can get started using the GCP free trial, [click here](https://cloud.google.com/free/). 

The BigQuery sandbox gives free access to the power of BigQuery subject to the sandbox's [limits](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/sandbox#limits). The sandbox allows use of the web UI in the Cloud Console without providing a credit card. Use the sandbox without creating a billing account or enabling billing for your project.

The web UI is the graphical interface used to create and manage BigQuery resources and to run SQL queries. 

1. To open the sandbox, click [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery)
2. Accept the terms of service.
3. Before you can use the BigQuery sandbox, you must create a project. Follow the prompts to create your new project.
4. After you create your project, the BigQuery web UI will display a sandbox banner like the following.

While using the sandbox, there is no need to create a billing account (supply a credit card), and you do not need to attach a billing account to the project.

### Existing GCP account or project

*If you have a Google Cloud Platform billing account already*, you can choose to either [create a new project] and use it or choose an existing project. Unlike the [Bigquery sandbox][Get started with the BigQuery sandbox], using a project with billing attached means that 1) the account will accrue charges and 2) usage will not be subject to the Sandbox limits.


## Access the OmicIDX Bigquery Dataset

Navigate to the [Bigquery dataset on Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?project=isb-cgc-01-0006&folder&organizationId&p=isb-cgc-01-0006&d=omicidx&page=dataset).

The Bigquery console is an online portal that allows basic queries and
data exploration of BigQuery datasets. Upon opening the OmicIDX
BigQuery link, the console should open with the OmicIDX dataset
already available in the dataset window.

```{r bigquerylanding, fig.cap='The OmicIDX dataset appears in the left "dataset" window.', out.width='100%', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('bigquery_landing.png')
```

`r blogdown::shortcode('alert', title='Notice', .content='After clicking on the OmicIDX dataset in the navigation window, "pinning" the OmicIDX dataset will keep it available when you come back to Bigquery. You can always click the link above again if you forget.')` 

```{r pinds, fig.cap='Clicking the "pin" button on the right will keep the OmicIDX dataset in your dataset navigator for easy access. ', out.width='100%', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('bigquery_pin.png')
```
