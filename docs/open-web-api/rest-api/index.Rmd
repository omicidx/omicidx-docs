  Using the RESTful OmicIDX to access and analyze omics data resources

## RESTful Concepts

Before focusing on any jargon or getting hung up on semantics, in the
case of the OmicIDX REST API, three components to the system are
important.

The first is that REST systems are typically composed of
_resources_. Any information that can be named can be a resource: a
document or image, a temporal service, a collection of other
resources, a non-virtual object (e.g. a person), and so on. In the
OmicIDX case, typical resources are things like:

- SRA Runs
- SRA Studies
- Biosample Sample records
- SRA Experiments
- SRA Samples
- GEO Platforms
- GEO Samples 
- GEO Series (studies)

REST uses a resource identifier to "name" the particular resource
involved in an interaction. In OmicIDX, these
resource identifiers are typically accessions, like *SRR000273*,
*SRX000273*, or *SAMND00000001*.

A REST API accesses _resources_ via _http_ calls. For example,
to access a specific SRA study record, one can use a URL like:

https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/studies/SRP014892

Accessing the URL from the linux command-line program using a program
like `curl` leads to facile programmatic access. More on programmatic
access follows.

REST is acronym for **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer. It is
architectural style for distributed systems and was first presented by
Roy Fielding in 2000 in his [famous dissertation].

## Retrieving records by accession

All of the common public omics data repositories include _accessions_
for their records. These accessions serve as keys in _OmicIDX_, so
they can be reused easily for quick lookup of records. When the
accession is known (such as when you find the accession in a pubmed
abstract), retrieving the metadata for that accession is a common
task. OmicIDX uses accessions from the original database, so eee table
\@ref(tab:tab1) for examples of what to look for.


Table: (\#tab:tab1) This table outlines the _resources_ and the
_resource identifiers, or accessions,_ in OmicIDX. Note how the format of
the accessions differs across resources. The "type of record" column
has multiple _Sample_ entries, for example, but each repository (GEO,
SRA, Biosample, etc.) has a unique data model. More details on the data
models are in the [SRA], [GEO], and [Biosample] sections. 

| Database | Example accession | Type of record |
|---|---|---|
| SRA | `SRP012682` | Study |
| SRA | `SRS357840` | Sample |
| SRA | `SRX178456` | Experiment |
| SRA | `SRR543404` | Run |
| Biosample | `SAMD00000001` | Sample |
| GEO | `GSM10` | Sample |
| GEO | `GSE2553` | Study (or Series) |
| GEO | `GPL96` | Platform |

### Get an individual record by accession

URLs for accessing individual records in OmicIDX follow a standard
form and are easy to construct. See Figure \@ref(fig:urldiagram) for details.

(ref:urldiagram) OmicIDX URLs to access omics metadata _resources_ by accession follow a pattern. In the diagramatic representation of an OmicIDX URL, box 1 is the server name. Box 2 is the originating database which is, in this case, the [SRA] database. Box 3 is the name of the resource within the originating database, here the studies collection. Finally, box 4 is the accession. Note that no `/` follows the accession. 


```{r urldiagram, fig.cap='(ref:urldiagram)', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('url_diagram.png')
```


For example, the SRA accession for the GTeX study is `SRP012682`. This
accession comes from the `sra` database and is a `study`, so we query
the following URL:

- https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/studies/SRP012682

Clicking on the link will return JSON results for the study record for
the GTeX study. Alternatively, one can use `curl` on the command line
to access the same URL. 

```{bash eval=FALSE}
curl -s 'https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/studies/SRP012682'
```

While `curl` will work fine to get results, the [httpie tool](https://httpie.org/) is a friendlier tool for querying web APIs. [Installation is straightforward](https://httpie.org/#installation). 

```{bash}
http 'https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/studies/SRP012682' \
    --pretty format
```

The [httr] package is useful in R for accessing web resources. The
following is a simple code example. 

```{r}
# Requires the httr package
#   install.packages('httr')
response = httr::GET("https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/studies/SRP012682")
content = httr::content(response)
content
```

In python, one might use the [requests] library to access the URL and
retrieve the data into a python object. 

```{python}
# requires the requests package be available
#   pip install requests
import requests, pprint
response = requests.get(
    "https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/studies/SRP012682"
)
pprint.pprint(response.json())
```

Each _resource_ (SRA Sample, for example) has a particular data model
that is shared across all members of that resource. However, different
_resources_ (SRA Sample vs SRA Study) will have different data models
(though some fields are common) from one another. To get a sense of
what other _resources_ look like, try clicking through these
links. For more details, see the data models for [SRA], [GEO], and
[Biosample].

- https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/biosample/samples/SAMD00000001


### Get records related to an accession

Another common task is to find all the records of one type for a
record of another type, e.g., all samples for a given study. For this
section, we will make the workflow a bit more realistic. [Mike Love]
routinely teaches about gene-level differential RNA-seq expression
using the [rnaseqGene Bioconductor
workflow](https://bioconductor.org/packages/rnaseqGene/). After
accessing the Bioconductor vignette, we note that the data used are
from [@Himes2014-zj].

[Mike Love]: https://mikelove.github.io/

To find SRA links from a PubMed record, look at the **Related
Information** section that will look like Figure
\@ref(fig:pubmedlinks). Clicking on the **SRA** link will reveal that
thethe related SRA study is `SRP033351`. Reviewing the single-record
access approach from the last section, this URL returns the details of
the study.

- https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/studies/SRP033351

```{r pubmedlinks, fig.cap='When viewing a PubMed abstract, the Related Information section may have link(s) out to omics databases. Clicking through on one of these links will reveal an accession that can be used for accessing OmicIDX', echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('imgs/pubmed_links.png')
```

Fetching all related samples given this study (see the [SRA data
model section][SRA] for how samples relate to a study) is
straightforward and the URL again follows a pattern.

- https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/studies/SRP033351/samples

The URLs for all related experiment and run records are, respectively:

- https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/studies/SRP033351/experiments 
- https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/studies/SRP033351/runs


Here are additional examples of accessing related records:

- https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/samples/SRS357840/experiments
- https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/samples/SRS357840/runs
- https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/studies/SRP012682/samples 
- https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/studies/SRP012682/experiments 
- https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/studies/SRP012682/runs
- https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/samples/SRS357840/experiments
- https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/samples/SRS357840/runs


## Counting and paging through results

API accesses and queries may include many millions of records, but the
OmicIDX REST API limits resultsets to batches of size <1000 records in
a single call to the API. This section addresses:

1. Choosing the number of results, or `size`, that are returned by each API call.
2. Paging through very large resultsets in chunks using the *cursor*.

### Adjusting the page *size*

Adding a `size` parameter to the URL above
modifies the _default resultset size of 10_ to be either smaller (down
to zero) or larger (up to 999). An example URL including the size
parameter looks like:

- https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/studies/SRP033351/samples?size=2

```{bash}
# curl -s 'https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/studies/SRP033351/samples?size=2'
http 'https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/studies/SRP033351/samples' \
    size==2 \
    --pretty format
```

Using a `size` of zero (0) is useful to capture just the count of the number of records. 

```{bash}
# curl -s 'https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/studies/SRP033351/samples?size=0'
http 'https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/studies/SRP033351/samples' \
    size==0 \
    --pretty format
```

Note that the `stats.total` part of the output gives the number
`16`. All data resultsets from the OmicIDX API will include this
annotation, giving the total number of results available given the
query or URL.

Another, larger study, such at GTeX (SRP015892) offers many more
samples. But how many?

```{bash}
# curl -s 'https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/studies/SRP012682/samples?size=0'
http 'https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/studies/SRP012682/samples' \
    size==0 \
    --pretty format
```

Therefore, the `size` parameter varies the number of results returned
by an API call. Using a `size` of zero (0) is a quick-and-dirty
approach to get a count of the number of records that would be
returned by an API call. This same trick can be used when counting
`search` results below.

### Using the *cursor* to page through large result sets.

The limitation on result set size is to mitigate problems with network
connectivity and to simplify somewhat the database backend
infrastructure. However, there are definitely result sets that are
larger than 999 records. How do we deal with that situation?

The OmicIDX API uses `paging`. In particular, the API uses
[cursor-based
paging](https://stackoverflow.com/a/49612308/459633). For each
result set that the API returns, if more results are available, there
will be a `cursor` field available that can be used as a parameter to
the _next_ API call to start with results *after* the cursor. Perhaps
it is easier to explain with an example:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
# curl -s 'https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/studies/SRP012682/samples?size=5'
http 'https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/studies/SRP012682/samples' \
    size==5 \
    --pretty format
```

If you run the line above, the result will include a `"cursor":
"LONG....STRING"` that might look like the following (your cursor may
be different).

```
...
  ],
  "cursor": "X2lkfHxhc2N8fHx8U1JTMTAxNzEzNw==",
  "stats": {
    "total": 14249,
    "took": 10
  },
  "success": true
}
...
```

Adding the cursor as a parameter to the same URL retrieves the next 5 results like so:


```{bash eval=TRUE, results='hide'}
# curl -s 'https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/studies/SRP012682/samples?size=5&cursor=X2lkfHxhc2N8fHx8U1JTMTAxNzEzNw=='
http 'https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/studies/SRP012682/samples' \
    size==5 \
	'cursor==X2lkfHxhc2N8fHx8U1JTMTAxNzEzNw==' \
    --pretty format
```

The next cursor value will look similar (for example,
"X2lkfHxhc2N8fHx8U1JTMTAxNzE0Mg=="). Continuing to play this game of
specifying the cursor when it is available allows *paging* through the
result set. When fetching results, the cursor will be available until
there are no more results to be fetched. Thus, when there is not a
`cursor` entry in the results, all results have been retrieved and any
looping code can stop.

Note a few assumptions/caveats here.

1. The `size` parameter dictates the number of results in one "page".
2. The `cursor` parameter is specific to the search or API
   query. Cursors cannot be reused across different queries.
3. When calling the API, the query should remain fixed when paging
   with a cursor (ie., use the same URL over again, changing only the
   cursor value).
4. Underlying the cursor functionality is a fixed sorting order (that
   is not currently a parameter that can be tweeked).


## Customizing returned fields

### Listing available fields

```{bash}
# curl -s 'https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/_mapping/study'
http 'https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/_mapping/study' \
    --pretty format
```

### Including or excluding specific fields from results

```{bash}
# curl -s 'https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/studies/SRP012682/samples?size=5&include_fields=accession&include_fields=title'
http 'https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/studies/SRP012682/samples' \
    'size==5' 'include_fields==accession' \
	'include_fields==title' \
	--pretty format
```

## Search

1. Decide what you want to search for: studies, samples, experiments, or runs.
2. Take a look at the output of one of the API calls on the previous slide for the entity type you want to search for.
3. Look closely at the field names and what is in them.
4. Form the query using [lucene query syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html).
5. Form the URL based like so, using `q=` to specify the query string. For example, to find all human RNA-seq experiments:

[`https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/experiments?q=library_strategy:"RNA-Seq" AND sample.taxon_id:9606`](https://api.omicidx.cancerdatasci.org/sra/experiments?q=library_strategy:"RNA-Seq" AND sample.taxon_id:9606)

The number of records can be tuned using `size=....` (up to 999 records).
