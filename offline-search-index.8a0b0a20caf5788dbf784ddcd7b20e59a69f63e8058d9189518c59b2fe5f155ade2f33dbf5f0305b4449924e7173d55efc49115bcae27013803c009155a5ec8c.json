Since Bigquery uses SQL, complex queries are possible and since Bigquery is cloud-scale, analytic queries are quite fast (usually just a few seconds, even over 10+ million records).\nBigquery requires a Google Cloud Project for billing purposes. Usage is based on amount of data processed per query. While the data in OmicIDX are largish, they are small for Bigquery, so costs will generally be low.\nTo access the Bigquery dataset online through the Bigquery cloud portal, navigate to the Bigquery OmicIDX dataset.\nAs with the web API, Bigquery clients exist for command line as well as for many programming languages.\n","excerpt":"Access and use the web service The web API is language-agnostic.

The Developer Documentation gives details of the individual repositories, their contents, and role in the OmicIDX ecosystem.\nThis project follows Google's Open Source Community Guidelines.\nCreating issues Alternatively, if there's something you'd like to see in Docsy (or if you've found something that isn't working the way you'd expect), but you're not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue.\nContributing to these docs This user guide is, like our example site, a Docsy site that uses the Hugo static site generator. We welcome updates to the docs!\nWe use Netlify to manage the deployment of the site and provide previews of doc updates. The instructions here assume you're familiar with basic GitHub workflows.\nQuick start with Netlify  Fork the Docsy repo on GitHub: this site's files live in the userguide subdirectory. Make your changes and send a pull request (PR). If you're not yet ready for a review, add \u0026ldquo;WIP\u0026rdquo; to the PR name to indicate it's a work in progress. (Don't add the Hugo property \u0026ldquo;draft = true\u0026rdquo; to the page front matter, because that prevents the auto-deployment of the content preview described in the next point.) Wait for the automated PR workflow to do some checks. When it's ready, you should see a comment like this: deploy/netlify — Deploy preview ready! Click Details to the right of \u0026ldquo;Deploy preview ready\u0026rdquo; to see a preview of your updates. Continue updating your doc and pushing your changes until you're happy with the content. When you're ready for a review, add a comment to the PR, and remove any \u0026ldquo;WIP\u0026rdquo; markers.  Updating a single page If you've just spotted something you'd like to change while using the docs, Docsy has a shortcut for you:\n Click Edit this page in the top right hand corner of the page. If you don't already have an up to date fork of the project repo, you are prompted to get one - click Fork this repository and propose changes or Update your Fork to get an up to date version of the project to edit. The appropriate page in your fork is displayed in edit mode. Follow the rest of the Quick start with Netlify process above to make and preview your changes.  Previewing your changes locally If you want to run your own local Hugo server to preview your changes as you work:\n  Follow the instructions in Getting started to install Hugo and any other tools you need.\n  Fork the Docsy repo into your own project, then create a local copy using git clone. Don’t forget to use --recurse-submodules or you won’t pull down some of the code you need to generate a working site.\ngit clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/google/docsy.git   Change to the userguide directory and run the following Hugo command to build the site and start the Hugo server. Note that you need the themesDir flag because the site files are inside the theme repo.\ncd userguide hugo server --themesDir ../.. By default your site will be available at http://localhost:1313/. Now that you're serving your site locally, Hugo will watch for changes to the content and automatically refresh your site.\n  Continue with the usual GitHub workflow to edit files, commit them, push the changes up to your fork, and create a pull request.\n  Creating an issue If there's something you'd like to see in the docs, but you're not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue in [this repository](wherever it goes). You can also create an issue about a specific page by clicking the Create Issue button in the top right hand corner of the page.\n","excerpt":"Contributing OmicIDX is an open source project and we love getting patches and contributions to make …","ref":"/docs/contribution-guidelines/","title":"Contribution Guidelines"},{"body":"Our Pledge We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.\nWe pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.\nOur Standards Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:\n Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community  Examples of unacceptable behavior include:\n The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks Public or private harassment Publishing others\u0026rsquo; private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting  Enforcement Responsibilities Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.\nCommunity leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.\nScope This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

We collect metadata from omics repositories, process it into computable forms, and make it available for search, analysis, bulk processing, and for integration with additional data resources.\nRead on to find out more, or visit our documentation to get started!\n       What does OmicIDX provide? There are a number of websites and projects that focus on omics metadata search. The OmicIDX project can be used for enhanced search (see Bigquery and Web API documentation), but an additional and key goal is to provide omics metadata in forms that enable data science. Natural language processing, bulk data mining, mapping to ontologies, or enrichment through linked data approaches are all applications we aim to enable.\nOmicIDX data resources are updated monthly or more frequently (depending on data source). In practice, we access, parse, and organize disparate omics metadata into JSON format and provide the results as:\n Downloadable files, suitable for bulk processing with R, python, or even to load to relational or NoSQL databases. Bigquery tables, ideal for performant data mining and for \u0026ldquo;joining\u0026rdquo; to other public or private datasets. A high performance web application programming interface (API), for language-agnostic search, querying, and data mining.  We develop all code to accomplish these tasks in the open. Contributions and reuse are welcome and encouraged!\n    We do the dirty work of omics data collection so you don't have to. We deal with some of the nitty-gritty details of collecting and consolidating omics metadata, reducing bottlenecks and clearing hurdles. Omics metadata stored by the repository are not always convenient to access in bulk. For example, NCBI GEO metadata are not available as a single \u0026ldquo;dump\u0026rdquo; file, necessitating a \u0026ldquo;crawl\u0026rdquo; of the site to get all available metadata. A wholistic view of a single resource, such as a biological sample, may require metadata from multiple repositories. In many cases, metadata from a single sample may be non-duplicative across repositories. Even when bulk \u0026ldquo;dumps\u0026rdquo; of metadata are available, such resources may be incomplete with respect to the information available from other sources, such as SRA metadata dumps. Gathering complete publicly available metadata requires additional work.     What's next for OmicIDX? Visit our Github project to see what we're currently working on.
